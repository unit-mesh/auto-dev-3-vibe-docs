================================================================================
USER PERSPECTIVE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Key observations about the new summary format:

1. ✅ PRIORITY FOCUS: Errors are shown first, then warnings, then info
   - Users immediately see critical issues that block the build
   - Can quickly assess if they need to fix something before code review

2. ✅ ACTIONABLE INFORMATION: Each issue shows:
   - Exact line number (where to look)
   - Clear message (what's wrong)
   - Rule name (for reference/learning)
   - No noise about linter installation/availability

3. ✅ CONCISE BUT COMPLETE:
   - Top-level stats give quick overview
   - Issues are truncated to top 5 per file (with "more" indicator)
   - Avoids overwhelming output while showing what matters

4. ✅ MULTI-FILE CLARITY:
   - Files grouped by severity
   - Easy to see which files need immediate attention
   - File paths are prominent

5. ✅ MULTI-LINTER SUPPORT:
   - Shows which linters actually ran
   - Handles different linters for different file types
   - Unified output format regardless of linter source

6. ✅ CLEAN CODE FEEDBACK:
   - When no issues found, gives positive confirmation
   - Users know linters ran successfully

What we DON'T show (and don't need to):
- Linter installation instructions (not relevant during code review)
- Which files could be linted but weren't (not actionable)
- Linter version numbers (rarely matters for the review)
- File-to-linter mappings (implicit from execution)

This summary provides exactly what a developer needs during code review:
- What files have problems?
- How serious are they?
- What are the specific issues?
- Where do I need to look?
